## Setup
1. _Clone_ down this repo. You can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
2. Then install the library dependencies. Run:
```
npm install
```
3. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## How to View Your Code in Action
1. In the terminal, run:
```bash
npm start
```
2. You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:
```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```
3. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.
